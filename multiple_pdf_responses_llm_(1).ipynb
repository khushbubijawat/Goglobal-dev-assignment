The document appears to be related to securities offerings and contains various terms and conditions, including mentions of \"Underlyings,\" \"Correlation of the Underlyings,\" \"we will pay you a cash payment on the,\" and \"Final Terms - Issuer.\" However, the specific CUSIP number is mentioned only once, in the context of \"dp159523_424b2-us2167699.htm,\" which is a link to the document.

The text contains multiple links to SEC filings, but without specifically looking at those filings, I cannot determine if they contain a CUSIP number or which one it might be. Therefore, I cannot share the CUSIP number with certainty.\n"
